AI Component Description

The current prototype and project documentation do not explicitly outline AI-specific implementations. However, potential AI applications can be inferred from the described features and feedback, particularly in enhancing the Reports and Transaction History functionalities:  

1. Trend Forecasting & Spending Insights 
   - The prototype mentions "trend forecasts" and "spending insights" on the Reports page.  
   - AI Opportunity: A machine learning model (e.g., time-series forecasting) could analyze historical transaction data to predict future spending trends. This would automate the generation of actionable insights (e.g., budget warnings, seasonal expense patterns).  

2. Automated Transaction Categorization
   - The "Manual Entry" page includes a category dropdown (e.g., Food, Transport).  
   - AI Opportunity: Natural Language Processing (NLP) could analyze transaction notes or descriptions to auto-categorize entries, reducing manual input errors and improving efficiency.  

3. Anomaly Detection
   - Transaction History allows filtering by date and category.  
   - AI Opportunity: An anomaly detection algorithm could flag unusual spending patterns (e.g., sudden large expenses) in real-time, enhancing financial oversight.  

4. Data Parsing & Import Optimization
   - The "Import Transactions" page supports CSV/JSON parsing.  
   - AI Opportunity: AI-driven data validation could improve error detection during file imports (e.g., mismatched formats, outlier detection).  

Implementation Considerations
- The project’s Java codebase (noted in the marksheet) could integrate libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn for model deployment.  
- Testing feedback highlights the need for detailed documentation and JUnit examples, which would be critical for validating AI components (e.g., model accuracy, edge cases).  
- The prototype’s low score (2/4) suggests prioritizing core functionalities first, with AI enhancements proposed as future iterations.  

Conclusion
While AI is not explicitly implemented in the current version, the system’s design provides foundational data structures (transaction records, categories) and use cases (forecasting, categorization) that align well with AI integration for advanced automation and analytics.
